    from sticking) and flatten each of the balls made previously, making sure to leave space between them.</p>

    <p>Place the pan in the preheated oven at 200 degrees Celsius, for around 20 minutes or until the edges of the cookies are
    darker. Remove from the oven, unmold after cooling and enjoy with the kids!</p>
