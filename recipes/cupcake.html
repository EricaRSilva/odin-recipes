    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <h3>Batter:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs - 2 units</li>
        <li>Sugar - 1 cup</li>
        <li>Wheat flour - 2 cups</li>
        <li>Milk - 1 tea-cup</li>
        <li>Melted butter - 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Baking powder- 1/2 tablespoon</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Cover:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Chopped chocolate - 200g</li>
        <li>Table cream - 100g</li>
        <li>Chocolate sprinkles</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Preparing:</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, pour one ingredient at a time and stir everything until you create a uniform mixture. Place it in molds
    and bake at medium temperature for 30 minutes.</p>
    
    <p>While the batter is baking, melt the chopped chocolate in a bain-marie or in the microwave (be careful not to burn it!)
    and mix with the table cream. Then, put it in the fridge until it hardens, reaching an ointment point. To spread the
    frosting over the cupcakes, use a piping tip or spoon. Add chocolate sprinkles to taste.</p>

    <p>After baking for the set time, wait for the cupcakes to cool and decorate as you prefer â€“ this is the time to create and
    have even more fun with the little ones!</p>
